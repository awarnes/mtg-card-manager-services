Data tag,Required,Format,Description
YEAST,Yes,Record,Starts a yeast ingredient record -- any of the below tags may be included in any order within the <YEAST>…. </YEAST> record tags.  Any non-standard tags in the yeast will be ignored.
NAME,Yes,Text,Name of the yeast.
VERSION,Yes,Integer,Version of the standard.  Should be “1” for this version.
TYPE,Yes,List,May be (“Ale” “Lager” “Wheat” “Wine” “Champagne”)
FORM,Yes,List,May be (“Liquid” “Dry” “Slant” “Culture”)
AMOUNT,Yes,Volume (liters) or Weight (kg),The amount of yeast measured in liters.  For a starter this is the size of the starter.  If the flag AMOUNT_IS_WEIGHT is set to TRUE then this measurement is in kilograms and not liters.
AMOUNT_IS_WEIGHT,No,Boolean,TRUE if the amount measurement is a weight measurement and FALSE if the amount is a volume measurement.  Default value (if not present) is assumed to be FALSE – therefore the yeast measurement is a liquid amount by default.
LABORATORY,No,Text,The name of the laboratory that produced the yeast.
PRODUCT_ID,No,Text,The manufacturer’s product ID label or number that identifies this particular strain of yeast.
MIN_TEMPERATURE,No,Temperature (C),The minimum recommended temperature for fermenting this yeast strain in degrees Celsius.
MAX_TEMPERATURE,No,Temperature (C),The maximum recommended temperature for fermenting this yeast strain in Celsius.
FLOCCULATION,No,List,May be (“Low” “Medium” “High” “Very High”)
ATTENUATION,No,Percent,Average attenuation for this yeast strain.
NOTES,No,Text,Notes on this yeast strain.  May be a multiline entry.
BEST_FOR,No,Text,Styles or types of beer this yeast strain is best suited for.
TIMES_CULTURED,No,Integer,Number of times this yeast has been reused as a harvested culture.  This number should be zero if this is a product directly from the manufacturer.
MAX_REUSE,No,Integer,Recommended of times this yeast can be reused (recultured from a previous batch)
ADD_TO_SECONDARY,No,Boolean,Flag denoting that this yeast was added for a secondary (or later) fermentation as opposed to the primary fermentation.  Useful if one uses two or more yeast strains for a single brew (eg: Lambic).  Default value is FALSE.

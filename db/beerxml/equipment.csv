Data tag,Required,Format,Description
EQUIPMENT,Yes,Record,Starts a EQUIPMENT record -- any of the below tags may be included in any order within the <EQUIPMENT>…. </EQUIPMENT> record tags.  Any non-standard tags in the equipment will be ignored.
NAME,Yes,Text,Name of the equipment profile – usually a text description of the brewing setup.
VERSION,Yes,Integer,Version of the equipment record.  Should always be “1” for this version of the XML standard.
BOIL_SIZE,Yes,Volume (liters),The pre-boil volume used in this particular instance for this equipment setup.  Note that this may be a calculated value depending on the CALC_BOIL_VOLUME parameter.
BATCH_SIZE,Yes,Volume (liters),The target volume of the batch at the start of fermentation.
TUN_VOLUME,No,Volume (liters),Volume of the mash tun in liters.  This parameter can be used to calculate if a particular mash and grain profile will fit in the mash tun.  It may also be used for thermal calculations in the case of a partially full mash tun.
TUN_WEIGHT,No,Weight (kg),Weight of the mash tun in kilograms.  Used primarily to calculate the thermal parameters of the mash tun – in conjunction with the volume and specific heat.
TUN_SPECIFIC_HEAT,No,Cal/gram-deg C,The specific heat of the mash tun which is usually a function of the material it is made of.  Typical ranges are 0.1-0.25 for metal and 0.2-0.5 for plastic materials.
TOP_UP_WATER,No,Volume (liters),The amount of top up water normally added just prior to starting fermentation.  Usually used for extract brewing.
TRUB_CHILLER_LOSS,No,Volume (liters),The amount of wort normally lost during transition from the boiler to the fermentation vessel.  Includes both unusable wort due to trub and wort lost to the chiller and transfer systems.
EVAP_RATE,No,Percent per hour,The percentage of wort lost to evaporation per hour of the boil.
BOIL_TIME,No,Normal boil time,The normal amount of time one boils for this equipment setup.  This can be used with the evaporation rate to calculate the evaporation loss.
CALC_BOIL_VOLUME,No,Boolean,Flag denoting that the program should calculate the boil size.  Flag may be TRUE or FALSE.  If TRUE then BOIL_SIZE = (BATCH_SIZE – TOP_UP_WATER – TRUB_CHILLER_LOSS) * (1+BOIL_TIME * EVAP_RATE )  If set then the boil size should match this value.
LAUTER_DEADSPACE,No,Volume (liters),Amount lost to the lauter tun and equipment associated with the lautering process.
TOP_UP_KETTLE,No,Volume (liters),Amount normally added to the boil kettle before the boil.
HOP_UTILIZATION,No,Percent,Large batch hop utilization.  This value should be 100% for batches less than 20 gallons but may be higher (200% or more) for very large batch equipment.
NOTES,No,Text,Notes associated with the equipment.  May be a multiline entry.

BeerXML

An XML Standard

for Beer Brewing Data

Version 1.0

 

Created by:

Brad Smith – “BeerSmith”

Drew Avis – “Strangebrew”

Michael Taylor – “SUDS”

Andrew Perron – “DrewBrew”

David Johnson – “QBrew”

 

 
Purpose

The primary purpose for the standard is the exchange of recipes, but it could also be used for the exchange of other brewing data.  For example a table of hops could be exported as a series of XML hop records in a single file.

 

The optional appendix adds tags for use in the display of brewing data using XML style sheets or XML compatible report generators.  As the tags in the appendix are for display only and may include rounded values.  We do not recommend relying on any of these tags for data import.

 
General

Brewing data will follow the XML standard as a basis.  To be compliant the program must be able to import or export the required tags, recognize the data formats and units, and follow basic XML conventions.  In addition the program may support optional tags that have “No” in the Required column.

 

For simplicity, the convention of using a separate tag for each data entry as in the following will be used:

<HOP>

 <NAME>Cascade</NAME>

</HOP>

 

Though equivalent, the following XML format (i.e. XML Attributes) should NOT be used.

 

<HOP NAME="Cascade"> </HOP>

 

Each new tag will be put on a separate line, with the start and end of the tag surrounding the data.  Tags starting and ending a record will be placed on their own line (see examples).

 
File Extension

The file extension “.xml” should be used for all BeerXML files.  For example, a recipe file might be named “recipes.xml”.

 
Comments

Comments may be embedded per the XML standard, but all comments shall be ignored by importing programs.

 

Sample XML comment

<!-- This is a comment line in the XML format  -->

 
Special Characters

The exporting and importing programs should recognize and translate the normal XML special character codes if they appear in any of the data strings.  These include:

 

Character
	

XML Code

&
	

&amp;

< 
	

&lt;

> 
	

&gt;

“
	

&quot;

‘
	

&apos;

 
XML Header

Per the XML standard, all files should begin with the following header line as the first line.  After the XML header a record set should start (for example <RECIPES>…</RECIPES> or <HOPS> … </HOPS>).

 

Required XML Header Example with Recipes tag:

 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>

<RECIPES>

   …

</RECIPES>

 
Tag Names

Tag names will be uppercase.  For example "HOP" is acceptable, but "hop" and Hop" are not.

 
Version

All records have a required <VERSION> tag that denotes the version of the XML standard.  All should be set to the integer 1 for this version of the standard.  It is our intent that future versions of the standard will be backward compatible with the older versions, but the VERSION tag allows newer programs to check for a higher version of the standard or do conversions if required to be backward compatible.

 
Non-Standard Tags

Per the XML standard, all non-standard tags will be ignored by the importing program.  This allows programs to store additional information if desired using their own tags.  Any tags not defined as part of this standard may safely be ignored by the importing program.

 
Data Formats

- Record Set – A special tag that starts a particular set of data.  For example an XML table that consists of a set of hops records might start with a <HOPS> tag to denote that this is the start of hops records.  After the last record, a </HOPS> tag would be used.

 

- Record - Denotes a tag that starts or ends a particular record -- for example "HOP" might start a hops record or "FERMENTABLE" might start a fermentable record.

 

- Percentage - Denotes a percentage - all percentages are expressed as percent out of 100- for example 10.4% is written as "10.4" and not "0.104"

 

- List - The data has only a fixed number of values that are selected from the list in the description table for the tag.  These items are case sensitive, and no other values are allowed.

 

- Text - The data is free format text.  For multiline entries, line breaks will be preserved where possible and the text may be truncated on import if the text is too long for the importing program to store.  Multiline entries may be split with either a newline (Unix format) or a carriage return – newline combination (DOS format).  Importing programs should accept either.

 

- Boolean - May be either TRUE or FALSE, with TRUE and FALSE in capitals.  A default value should be specified for optional fields - the default is used if the value is not present.

 

- Integer - An integer number with no decimal point.  May include negative values - examples include ...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,...

 

- Floating Point - A floating point number, usually expressed in its simplest form with a decimal point as in "1.2", "0.004", etc...  Programs shall endeavor to store as many significant digits as possible to avoid truncating or losing small values.
 
Units

For this portion of the standard ALL units must be fixed.  It is the responsibility of the importing or exporting program to convert to and from the units below if needed.
Weight Units

All weights will be measured in Kilograms (kg).  For small values the exporting program will make an effort to preserve as many significant digits as possible.
Volume Units

All volumes will be measured in Liters (l).  For small values the exporting program will make an effort to preserve as many significant digits as possible.
Temperature Units

All temperatures will be measured in degrees Celsius.
Time Units

All times will be in minutes or fractions thereof – unless otherwise specified in the tag description.
Specific Gravity Units

Specific Gravity will be measured relative to the weight of the same size sample of water. For example “1.035”, “1.060”, etc…
Pressure Units

Pressures will be measured in kilopascals (kPa)

 

 
Record Sets

The following special tags are used to denote a set of records.  This allows more than one record of a single type to be embedded within a recipe, and also allows separate XML tables to be exported and imported.  For example a standalone collection of hops records might be exported as a “HOPS” table by starting the table with <HOPS>, continuing with a number of hops records and ending the table with </HOPS>

 

In a recipe, these record set identifiers are also used to separate records of different types.  For example, all HOP records used in a recipe will be enclosed between <HOPS>…</HOPS> identifiers.

Volume (liters)
	

The target volume of the batch at the start of fermentation.

TUN_VOLUME
	

No

PRIMING_SUGAR_EQUIV
	

No
	

Floating point
	

Factor used to convert this priming agent to an equivalent amount of corn sugar for a bottled scenario.  For example, “Dry Malt Extract” would have a value of 1.4 because it requires 1.4 times as much DME as corn sugar to carbonate.  To calculate the amount of DME needed, the program can calculate the amount of corn sugar needed and then multiply by this factor.

KEG_PRIMING_FACTOR
	

No
	

Floating point
	

Used to factor in the smaller amount of sugar needed for large containers.  For example, this might be 0.5 for a typical 5 gallon keg since naturally priming a keg requires about 50% as much sugar as priming bottles.

Appendix A

Optional Extensions for

BeerXML Display
 
Purpose

This document describes optional extensions that may be exported by a particular beer program to enhance the easy display of data and construction of XML style sheets.

 

These options are NOT required and all may not be supported by a particular program.  Where implemented, these tags provide a consistent method for display only.  None of these values should be used for import as the display value may be rounded from the true value.

 

 
Standards

All standards of the original BeerXML description also apply here with the exception of units – all fields that are defined for display only may also use a unit tag after them.    For example “3.45 gal” is an acceptable value.  For consistency, the recognized unit tags are described below.
Units

The following units are allowed and may be used interchangeably.  However, only units of the appropriate type may be used for a given value.  For example "volume" units may not be used for "Weight" fields.

qt – Quarts (US)

ml - Milliliters

l – Liters
Temperature Units

F – Degrees Fahrenheit

C – Degrees Celsius
Time Units

min - Minutes

hour - Hours

day – Days

week – Weeks
Color Units

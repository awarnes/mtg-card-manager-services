Data tag,Required,Format,Description
FERMENTABLE,Yes,Record,Starts a fermentable ingredient record -- any of the below tags may be included in any order within the <FERMENTABLE>…. </FERMENTABLE> record tags.  Any non-standard tags in the fermentable will be ignored.
NAME,Yes,Text,Name of the fermentable.
VERSION,Yes,Integer,Should be set to 1 for this version of the XML standard.  May be a higher number for later versions but all later versions shall be backward compatible.
TYPE,Yes,List,May be ("Grain" "Sugar" "Extract" "Dry Extract" "Adjunct").  Extract refers to liquid extract.
AMOUNT,Yes,Weight (kg),Weight of the fermentable extract or sugar in Kilograms.
YIELD,Yes,Percent,Percent dry yield (fine grain) for the grain or the raw yield by weight if this is an extract adjunct or sugar.
COLOR,Yes,Floating Point,The color of the item in Lovibond Units (SRM for liquid extracts).
ADD_AFTER_BOIL,No,Boolean,May be TRUE if this item is normally added after the boil.  The default value is FALSE since most grains are added during the mash or boil.
ORIGIN,No,Text,Country or place of origin
SUPPLIER,No,Text,Supplier of the grain/extract/sugar
NOTES,No,Text,Textual noted describing this ingredient and its use.  May be multiline.
COARSE_FINE_DIFF,No,Percent,Percent difference between the coarse grain yield and fine grain yield.  Only appropriate for a "Grain" or "Adjunct" type otherwise this value is ignored.
MOISTURE,No,Percent,Percent moisture in the grain.  Only appropriate for a "Grain" or "Adjunct" type otherwise this value is ignored.
DIASTATIC_POWER,No,Floating Point,The diastatic power of the grain as measured in "Lintner" units. Only appropriate for a "Grain" or "Adjunct" type otherwise this value is ignored.
PROTEIN,No,Percent,The percent protein in the grain.  Only appropriate for a "Grain" or "Adjunct" type otherwise this value is ignored.
MAX_IN_BATCH,No,Percent,The recommended maximum percentage (by weight) this ingredient should represent in a batch of beer.
RECOMMEND_MASH,No,Boolean,TRUE if it is recommended the grain be mashed FALSE if it can be steeped.  A value of TRUE is only appropriate for a "Grain" or "Adjunct" types.  The default value is FALSE.  Note that this does NOT indicate whether the grain is mashed or not – it is only a recommendation used in recipe formulation.
IBU_GAL_PER_LB,No,Floating Point,For hopped extracts only - an estimate of the number of IBUs per pound of extract in a gallon of water.  To convert to IBUs we multiply this number by the "AMOUNT" field (in pounds) and divide by the number of gallons in the batch.  Based on a sixty minute boil.  Only suitable for use with an "Extract" type otherwise this value is ignored.
